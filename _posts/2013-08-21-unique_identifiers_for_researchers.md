## The Problem

Two large challenges that researchers face today are discovery and
evaluation. We are overwhelmed by the volume of new research works, and
traditional discovery tools are no longer sufficient. We are spending
considerable amounts of time optimizing the impact -- and
discoverability -- of our research work so as to support grant
applications and promotions, and the traditional measures for this are
not enough.

Research is increasingly global and many interactions do not happen at a
personal level anymore, but rather through online tools, from email to
videoconferencing and online databases. Researchers have traditionally
been identified by their names, but this has never worked reliably
because of confusions between popular names (John Smith or Kim Lee),
errors in transliteration (e.g. MÃ¼ller becomes Mueller or Muller), and
name changes through marriage. These name issues present an even greater
challenge when we try to find out more about researchers who we do not
know personally, for example an author of a paper we find interesting or
an interesting speaker at a conference, or about the research going on
in an institution where we have applied for a job.

## Unique Identifiers as a Solution

The only way to uniquely identify a researcher is through an identifier
rather than a name. We, of course, use unique identifiers already with
usernames for email, social media accounts, institutional accounts, and
more. What is missing is a standard unique researcher identifier that is
widely used by academic institutions, funders, publishers, and online
tools and services for researchers, which is embedded in research
workflows and that automates the process of connecting researchers and
their research. The existing researcher identifier services and social
networks for scientists do not fill that gap. Many of the existing
solutions are limited to a geographic region or discipline, many
researchers and institutions are reluctant to use a commercial service,
and some of the open solutions do not have the wide support from the
community needed to reach critical mass.

[Open Researcher & Contributor ID (ORCID)](http://orcid.org) is an international, interdisciplinary, open
and not-for-profit organization created to solve the researcher name
ambiguity problem for the benefit of all stakeholders. ORCID was built
with the goal of becoming the universally accepted unique identifier for
researchers:

1.  ORCID is a community-driven organization
2.  ORCID is not limited by discipline, institution, or geography
3.  ORCID is an inclusive and transparently governed not-for profit
    organization
4.  ORCID data and source code are available under recognized open
    licenses
5.  the ORCID iD is part of institutional, publisher, and funding agency
    infrastructures

Furthermore, ORCID recognizes that existing researcher and identifier
schemes serve specific communities, and is working to link with, rather
than replace, existing infrastructures. One example is [ISNI](http://www.isni.org/), the International Standard Name Identifier. ORCID is [working closely](http://orcid.org/blog/2013/04/22/orcid-and-isni-issue-joint-statement-interoperation-april-2013) with ISNI and has for example [launched a web service](http://isni2orcid.labs.orcid-eu.org/) in early 2014 that allows researchers to link their ISNI and ORCID identifiers.

## ORCID Registry

The ORCID Registry launched in October 2012, and as of February 2013
more than 60,000 researchers have registered. Use of the Registry is
free: individuals may create, edit, and share their ORCID record. ORCID
staff, infrastructure, and software development is supported by member
fees for organizations embedding the iD into systems.

Many organizations have started to integrate ORCID identifiers into
their infrastructure. In early 2013, this includes manuscript submission
systems from several publishers (Nature Publishing Group, Copernicus,
Hindawi, and others), linkage with other identifier schemes (Scopus,
ResearcherID, Faculty of 1000), and integration with research works
databases such as CrossRef and Figshare. The first services building on
top of the Registry have also emerged, including altmetrics (see chapter
12, Fenner: Altmetrics and Other Novel Measures for Scientific Impact)
tools to track the impact of all research outputs linked to a particular
ORCID identifier.

## Outlook

One of the stated goals of the ORCID initiative is to facilitate linkage
with all research outputs: papers, monographs, books, datasets,
software, peer review, clinical trials, patents, grants, etc. By
providing a switchboard for this information, ORCID can help raise
awareness of -- and credit for -- important research and scholarly
activities and help the research community develop tools and metrics to
better understand and evaluate impact. By embedding the ORCID iD in
research workflows, ORCID can also help to reduce the time researchers
spend on administrative and reporting activities, including publication
lists for institutions and funders, submissions to the institutional
repository, and more. Unique identifiers for researchers and research
outputs can automate much of this reporting, giving researchers more
time to do actual research. Widespread adoption of unique researcher
identifiers will foster the development of exciting new tools and
services for researchers which will make science more collaborative,
productive, and interesting.
